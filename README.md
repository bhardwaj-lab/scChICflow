## How to run

### 1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/vivekbhr/openTAPS.git
```

### 2. Go to the cloned directory and set up conda env for the workflow

```
cd openTAPS
conda env create -f env.yaml -n taps
```

### 3. configure the config.yaml

The workflow needs
1) path to the (indexed) genome fasta file
2) path to BWA index (basename)
3) path to taps cell barcodes (.txt file)
4) path to blacklisted regions in the genome (bed file)
5) Name of "method", ('chic', 'chic-taps' or 'nla-taps')

Copy the `config.yaml` from the folder to your output folder (where you intend to run the pipeline) and replace the information with your relevant information.

### 4. Test workflow with test fasta.

This should only take 3-4 minutes. Copy the test fastq files provided with the repo (testdata) folder and run the workflow like this:

(provided all files in `config.yaml` are accessible)

```
conda activate taps
## for outsiders:
<openTAPS_folder>/openTAPS -i <testdata_folder> -o <output_folder> -c <your_config.yaml> -j <jobs> -cl
## for van Oudenaarden group:
mkdir testresults && cd testresults
.././openTAPS -i ../testdata -o . -c ../config.yaml -j 10 -cl
```


here **j** is the number of parallel jobs you want to run, **-cl** means submit to cluster (default is to run locally)

### Technical Notes
  - After running the pipeline, **LOG** file are stored in the **<output>/log/** directory and the workflow top-level log is in openTAPS.log file.
  - Currently the -o option is not very flexible and and pipeline works only when it's executed in the output directory.
  - cluster configuration, such as memory and cluster submission command are placed in `cluster_config.yaml`, and can be modified to suite the users internal infrastructure.

## Notes on processing
  - Quality-trimming of the data seems to remove the NLA3 sequences from the 5'-end of R1, which leads to
    rejection of reads during methylation tagging in the NLA-TAPS library. Turn 'trim: False' in the config.yaml to
    turn off trimming for NLA-TAPS library
